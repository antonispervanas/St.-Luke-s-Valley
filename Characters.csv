0;Simon Mathews;34;TRUE;Simon is a secretive man and he doesn't seem to be particularly social.

1;Tony Blake;27;TRUE;Tony is a simple man. He lives with his family and spends most of his time working on their farm. Not a religious person but his way of life is much closer to God than most of the people here.;C:\Users\ΑντώνηςΠερβανάς\Desktop\Tony\St. Luke's Valley\CSVs\Dialogs1.csv;Hard working.;Virtuous.;Very close with his family.;Not religious.;Visits the Tavern from time to time.
2;Alfred Lester;46;TRUE;I have wtinessed many people devoting their life to God but not many like Alfred. Ever since his son died on that accident, his life changed drastically. He spends countless hours everyday visiting the church. Sometimes he even comes earlier than me. When he is not in the church his life doesn't seem to be any different either, as I have seen him pray on his house garden. Although it pleases me to see people trully love God, this kind of zealot behaviour makes me worry about his mental state.;C:\Users\ΑντώνηςΠερβανάς\Desktop\Tony\St. Luke's Valley\CSVs\Dialogs2.csv;Seems isolated.;Very religious.;Possibly mentally unstable.;Lost his son on an accident.;Lives with his wife.
3;Carol Langston;17;TRUE;Carol is younger daughter of the Langston family. She is very close with her family and particularly with her sister Madison.

4;Madison Langston;20;TRUE;Being the older sister of the Langstone family, Madison has a lot more responsibilities than her younger sister Carol. She helps her parents at the farm and also takes care of Carol. It's no secret that those two are very close. There is also a boyfriend in her life, Kenton Darby. It's true that as priest I shouldn't approve of this kind of behaviour before marriage but they are both so innocent and loving, it makes me smile when I see them.;C:\Users\ΑντώνηςΠερβανάς\Desktop\Tony\St. Luke's Valley\CSVs\Dialogs4.csv;Responsible.;Very close with her sister.;In love with Kenton Darby;;
